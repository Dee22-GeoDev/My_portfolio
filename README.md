## ðŸ“„ Project Description

This project is my submission for the **PLP Academy Portfolio Challenge**, where I built a personal portfolio website using **HTML** and **CSS** to showcase my skills, background, and achievements.  

The portfolio includes:
- **About Me** â€“ A brief introduction about my journey and passion for tech.
- **Programming Languages** â€“ A list of languages and tools Iâ€™m proficient in.
- **Educational Background** â€“ My academic qualifications with a downloadable CV.
- **Interests** â€“ Key areas in tech that inspire me.
- **Projects** â€“ Highlighted works with descriptions and relevant links.
- **Contact Form** â€“ For easy communication with potential collaborators or employers.  

This project demonstrates my creativity, attention to detail, and ability to structure a web page that is both functional and visually appealing.
